<h2>Unusual diet</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/cabybara-facts" style="background-color: beige;">Like other rodents, capybaras&prime; teeth grow continuously, and they wear them down by grazing on aquatic plants, grasses, and other plentiful plants.<br>

    They also eat their own feces in the morning. That&prime;s when their poo is protein rich from the high number of microbes digesting the previous day&prime;s meals. Because the grasses they eat are so hard to digest, eating their waste essentially allows them to digest it twice.</blockquote>
<h2>Breeding and population</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/cabybara-facts" style="background-color: beige;">Capybaras don&prime;t mind being alone, but they also live in groups of up to 40. Their breeding season varies throughout the year depending on what habitat they live in and the availability of mates. Females usually have one litter of four to five young per year.<br>

    Though considered to have a stable population overall, in some areas capybaras are severely threatened by people who hunt them for their skin, and some local populations have been wiped out.</blockquote>
